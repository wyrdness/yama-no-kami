## ⛩️ Religious Tradition Notice

**Yama-no-kami is part of LIVING SHINTO RELIGIOUS TRADITION.**

Please approach with the same respect you would give any living religious tradition.

## Overview

Yama-no-kami, the mountain god or deity, is a significant kami (deity/spirit) in Japanese Shinto tradition and folklore. Unlike yokai, Yama-no-kami is a deity commanding reverence and respect, with active worship continuing at Shinto shrines throughout Japan.

The kami's appearance varies significantly by region—depicted as an old woman in some areas, a beautiful woman in others, and even as a male deity in certain regions.

One of the most distinctive aspects of Yama-no-kami is the **seasonal transformation**: in winter, the deity presides over mountains and forests, but in spring descends to the rice paddies and becomes **Ta-no-kami** (rice field god), returning to the mountains in autumn. This dual nature reflects the agricultural cycle and the deep connection between mountains and rice cultivation.

Yama-no-kami protects mountains, forests, and those who respectfully enter them—particularly hunters, woodcutters, and mountain travelers. **Strict taboos** surround interaction with the deity, and violations can result in misfortune or death.

### The Dual Nature

Yama-no-kami exhibits a **remarkable seasonal transformation** tied to agricultural cycles:

#### Winter/Autumn: Mountain God
- Resides in mountains
- Protects forests and wilderness
- Watches over hunters and travelers
- Mountain shrines active

#### Spring/Summer: Ta-no-kami (Rice Field God)
- Descends from mountains to rice paddies
- Protects rice cultivation
- Ensures good harvest
- Field shrines receive offerings

**The Cycle**:
```
Spring → Descends to rice fields as Ta-no-kami
Summer → Protects growing rice
Autumn → Returns to mountains after harvest
Winter → Resides in mountains as Yama-no-kami
```

This transformation reflects the **deep connection** between mountains (source of water) and rice cultivation in Japanese agriculture and spirituality.
