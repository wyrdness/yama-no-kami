      "summary": "Mountain god or deity in Shinto tradition. Appears in various forms depending on region, protects mountains and forests, transforms seasonally into Ta-no-kami (rice field god). Active worship continues at Shinto shrines.",
      "full": "Yama-no-kami, the mountain god or deity, is a significant kami (deity/spirit) in Japanese Shinto tradition and folklore. Unlike yokai, Yama-no-kami is a deity commanding reverence and respect, with active worship continuing at Shinto shrines throughout Japan. The kami's appearance varies significantly by region—depicted as an old woman in some areas, a beautiful woman in others, and even as a male deity in certain regions. One of the most distinctive aspects of Yama-no-kami is the seasonal transformation: in winter, the deity presides over mountains and forests, but in spring descends to the rice paddies and becomes Ta-no-kami (rice field god), returning to the mountains in autumn. This dual nature reflects the agricultural cycle and the deep connection between mountains and rice cultivation in Japanese culture. Yama-no-kami protects mountains, forests, and those who respectfully enter them—particularly hunters, woodcutters, and mountain travelers. Strict taboos surround interaction with the deity: cutting certain sacred trees, hunting on specific days, and disrespectful behavior can incur severe consequences including misfortune, accidents, or death. Hunters traditionally leave offerings before entering mountains and observe seasonal restrictions. The relationship with tengu (mountain spirits) varies by region, with some traditions viewing tengu as messengers or servants of Yama-no-kami. As a living religious tradition rather than folklore, Yama-no-kami worship reflects the ongoing Shinto reverence for nature spirits and the sacred character of mountains in Japanese spirituality."
