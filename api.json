      "full": "Yama-no-kami, the mountain god or deity, is a significant kami (deity/spirit) in Japanese Shinto tradition and folklore. Unlike yokai, Yama-no-kami is a deity commanding reverence and respect, with active worship continuing at Shinto shrines throughout Japan. The kami's appearance varies significantly by region—depicted as an old woman in some areas, a beautiful woman in others, and even as a male deity in certain regions. One of the most distinctive aspects of Yama-no-kami is the **seasonal transformation**: in winter, the deity presides over mountains and forests, but in spring descends to the rice paddies and becomes **Ta-no-kami** (rice field god), returning to the mountains in autumn. This dual nature reflects the agricultural cycle and the deep connection between mountains and rice cultivation. Yama-no-kami protects mountains, forests, and those who respectfully enter them—particularly hunters, woodcutters, and mountain travelers. **Strict taboos** surround interaction with the deity, and violations can result in misfortune or death."
